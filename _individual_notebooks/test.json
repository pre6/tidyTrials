In addition, the long-term effect of mitapivat on efficacy and safety will be explored in an open-label extension portion.","detailedDescription":"Mitapivat is a small molecule, oral activator of pyruvate kinase R (PKR). PKR is involved with maintaining health, energy, and longevity of red blood cells (RBCs). The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with mitapivat in participants with sickle cell disease. The study is a Phase 2/3 study in which the recommended dose of mitapivat will be selected and further evaluated. The Phase 2 portion includes a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled period in which participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 2 dose levels of mitapivat or placebo. The Phase 3 portion includes a 52-week randomized, placebo-controlled period in which participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the recommended mitapivat dose level or placebo. Participants who complete either the Phase 2 or Phase 3 portion will have the option to move into a 216-week open label extension period to receive mitapivat."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell

In this Phase II, the drug will be used to treat pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma including patients who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy.","detailedDescription":"Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly debilitating pediatric brain tumor that lacks medical anti-tumor therapies. Current therapy, which depends largely on surgery and radiation, is associated with poor quality of life and becomes more challenging and risky in the setting of recurrent disease. Recent discoveries regarding the biological characteristics of ACP indicate that available agents, including IL-6 pathway blockers may have efficacy in the control of ACP. We hypothesize that the IL6- receptor antagonist ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) will be safe and effective at inducing tumor response in children with residual ACP.\n\nIn this study, up to 38 patients will receive tocilizumab at the dose approved for pediatric Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (\\< 30 kg: 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; ≥30 kg: 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks).

The study medicine is in ointment form.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who\n\nIf they have Atopic Dermatitis (AD):\n\n* Have a diagnosis for at least 3 months\n* Have a diagnosis of mild or moderate disease assessed using Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)\n* Have percent Body Surface Area (%BSA) covering 5% up to 40%\n* A Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) average score of ≥2 during the screening period\n\nIf they have plaque psoriasis (PsO):\n\n* Have a diagnosis for at least 6 months\n* Have a diagnosis of mild, moderate, or severe disease assessed using Physician's Global Assessment (PGA)\n* Have percent Body Surface Area (%BSA) covering 2% up to 20%\n\nAll participants in this study will receive either 0.01% PF-07038124, 0.03% PF-07038124, or a vehicle ointment. In addition, some participants with PsO will receive 0.06% PF- PF-07038124. Participants will not know which dose level they have received. The participants will be randomly assigned to each dose group.\n\nPF-07038124 ointment will be applied topically to affected areas once daily. We will compare the experiences of people receiving the different dose levels of the ointment to those who receive the vehicle ointment. This will help us determine if PF-07038124 ointment is safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will take part in this study for approximately 21 weeks. Participants will apply the study medicine once daily for 12 weeks followed by a safety follow-up period of 4-5 weeks from last application of study medicine to last visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atopic Dermatitis","Plaque Psoriasis"],"keywords":["Eczema","topical"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":263,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atopic Dermatitis PF-07038124 0.01% ointment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Atopic Dermatitis","interventionNames":["Drug: PF-07038124 ointment 0.01%"]},{"label":"Atopic Dermatitis Vehicle ointment","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Atopic Dermatitis","interventionNames":["Drug: Vehicle ointment"]},{"label":"Atopic Dermatitis PF-07038124 0.03% ointment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Atopic Dermatitis","interventionNames":["Drug: PF-07038124 ointment 0.03%"]},{"label":"Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.01% ointment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Plaque Psoriasis","interventionNames":["Drug: PF-07038124 ointment 0.01%"]},{"label":"Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.03% ointment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Plaque Psoriasis","interventionNames":["Drug: PF-07038124 ointment 0.03%"]},{"label":"Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.06% ointment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Plaque Psoriasis","interventionNames":["Drug: PF-07038124 ointment 0.06%"]},{"label":"Plaque Psoriasis Vehicle ointment","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Plaque Psoriasis","interventionNames":["Drug: Vehicle ointment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"PF-07038124 ointment 0.01%","description":"Atopic Dermatitis and Plaque Psoriasis","armGroupLabels":["Atopic Dermatitis PF-07038124 0.01% ointment","Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.01% ointment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vehicle ointment","description":"Atopic Dermatitis and Plaque Psoriasis","armGroupLabels":["Atopic Dermatitis Vehicle ointment","Plaque Psoriasis Vehicle ointment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PF-07038124 ointment 0.03%","description":"Atopic Dermatitis and Plaque Psoriasis","armGroupLabels":["Atopic Dermatitis PF-07038124 0.03% ointment","Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.03% ointment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PF-07038124 ointment 0.06%","description":"PF-07038124 ointment 0.06% (Plaque Psoriasis only)","armGroupLabels":["Plaque Psoriasis PF-07038124 0.06% ointment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) and a Reduction From Baseline of More Than or Equal to (>=) 2 Points at Week 12: Participants With Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Only","description":"IGA assessed severity of AD on 5-point scale ranging from 0(clear)to 4(severe)higher scores indicate more severity,reflecting a global consideration of erythema (ery),induration and scaling.

Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NIMBC) is the most common form (\\~ 75%). The standard treatment involves the use of intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Nonetheless, 30-40% of the patients still relapse or progress. Clinical and laboratory research suggests that medications targeting the androgen receptor, such as bicalutamide, combined with the standard treatment with BCG may decrease the recurrence rate of NMIBC.\n\nThe study is composed of two cohort A (open-label, around 40 patients) and B (double-blind, with placebo, around 120 patients).\n\nIn the cohort A, the participants will be randomized to either the treatment with 1) daily intake of 150 mg bicalutamide for 3 months overlapping with the 6 cycles of intravesical instillations of BCG or 2) the standard of care of 6 cycles of intravesical instillation BCG.\n\nIn the cohort B, the participants will be randomized to either the treatment with 1) daily intake of 150 mg bicalutamide for 3 months overlapping with the 6 cycles of intravesical instillations of BCG or 2) daily intake of 150mg placebo for 3 months + the standard of care of 6 cycles of intravesical instillation BCG.\n\nThe participation in this trial should last 36 months from the screening visit to the last follow-up visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer"],"keywords":["Bicalutamide","BCG instillation","Placebo"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"The study started with cohort A (open-label study) for around 40 participants.

The second part of this study will also help to find out if the cisplatin given weekly approach will extend patients' life by at least the same amount of time as the cisplatin given every three weeks approach. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Radiation with low-dose cisplatin given weekly may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing head and neck cancer or preventing its recurrence.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether radiation with cisplatin weekly is superior in terms of acute toxicity, as measured by the T-scores (TAME method), to radiation with cisplatin every 3 weeks for patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). (Phase II) II. To determine whether radiation with cisplatin weekly is non-inferior to radiation with cisplatin every 3 weeks in terms of overall survival (OS) for patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN. (Phase III) III. To determine whether radiation with cisplatin weekly is superior in terms of acute toxicity, as measured by the T-scores (TAME method), to radiation with cisplatin every 3 weeks for patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN. (Phase III)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess and compare progression-free survival (PFS) between arms. II. To assess and compare locoregional failure and distant metastasis between arms.\n\nIII. To assess acute and late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version 5.0).\n\nIV. To assess patient-reported outcomes quality of life (PRO/QOL), as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck (FACT-H\\&N) (primary PRO), between arms.\n\nV. To assess hearing loss, as measured by audiograms and the modified TUNE grading scale between arms.\n\nVI. To assess hearing loss, as measured by speech audiometry Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant word scores and tympanometry (subject to the modified TUNE grading scale testing results; otherwise, it will be an exploratory objective).\n\nVII. To assess hearing-related QOL as measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory-Screening (HHIA-S) (secondary PRO), between arms.\n\nVIII. To assess long-term PFS, OS, and toxicity between arms. IX. To assess 3-year restricted-mean survival time for OS and PFS between arms (if long-term update is warranted).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To collect blood and tissue specimens for future translational science studies. For instance, to examine how germline and somatic genetic variants, such as TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, PTEN, NFE2L2, and KEAP1, may influence cisplatin-related efficacy and toxicity, and to assess the effect of regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use and genomic activation of PIK3CA (mutation or amplification) or loss of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, on disease-free survival or overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (NON-OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER \\[OPC\\]/p16-NEGATIVE OPC group and p16-NEGATIVE OPC/CANCER OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY \\[CUP\\] group): Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (on days 1, 22, and 43) during radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II (NON-OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER \\[OPC\\]/p16-NEGATIVE OPC group and p16-NEGATIVE OPC/CANCER OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY \\[CUP\\] group): Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

A cell block obtained from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimen may be used as the sole diagnostic tissue. Centers are encouraged to contact the pathology chair for clarification.\n\n* Note: Institutions must screen patients for p16 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in order to be eligible for the trial using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. A rigorous laboratory accreditation process similar to the United States (U.S.) CLIA certification, such as the provincial accreditation status offered by the Ontario Laboratory Accreditation (OLA) Program in Canada, the College of American Pathologists (CAP), or an equivalent accreditation in other countries, is acceptable.\n\n  * The p16 results must be reported on the pathology report being submitted. The p16 positivity is defined as \\> 70% of tumor cells showing strong nuclear and/or cytoplasmic immunostaining with p16 antibody.\n  * For patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries: Analysis of p16 status is NOT required.\n\n    * Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease at the primary site or at nodal stations. Simple tonsillectomy or local excision of the primary without removal of nodal disease is permitted, as is excision removing gross nodal disease but with intact primary site. Limited neck dissections retrieving =\\< 4 nodes are permitted and considered as non-therapeutic nodal excisions\n    * Clinical stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer \\[AJCC\\], 8th ed.), including no distant metastases based on the following diagnostic workup:\n  * History/physical examination within 60 days prior to registration\n  * One of the following imaging studies is required within 60 days prior to registration:\n* Computed tomography (CT) scan of neck (diagnostic quality with contrast, unless contraindicated) OR\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck (diagnostic quality with contrast, unless contraindicated) OR\n* Fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT of the neck; the CT component must be of diagnostic quality with contrast, unless contraindicated.\n\n  * Note: A diagnostic quality CT or MRI with contrast or FDG-PET/CT scan of neck performed for the purposes of radiation planning may serve as both staging and planning tools\n\n    * One of the following imaging studies is required within 60 days prior to registration:\n* FDG-PET/CT of the chest; FDG-PET/CT scan is strongly preferred and highly recommended to be used for eligibility OR\n* Chest CT\n\n  * Exam with laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror or in office direct procedure acceptable) within 70 days prior to registration;\n* Eligibility by patient cohort;\n\n  * Non-OPC/p16-negative OPC Cohort; Tumor Site: Larynx/Hypopharynx; Clinical Staging (AJCC, 8th ed.): T3-4 N0 or T1-4 N1-3 T2 N0 (hypopharynx only)\n  * Tumor Site: p16-negative OPC; Clinical Staging (AJCC, 8th ed.): T2N1, T1-4 N2-3, or T3-4 N0-1\n* p16-positive OPC/CUP Cohort;\n\n  * Tumor Site: OPC; Smoking Status: =\\< 10 pack-years; Clinical Staging (AJCC, 8th ed.): T1-3 N2-3 or T4 N0-3\n  * Tumor Site: OPC; Smoking Status: \\> 10 pack-years; Clinical Staging (AJCC, 8th ed.): T1N2-3, T2N1-3, or T3-4 N0-3\n  * Tumor Site: CUP; Smoking Status: Any; Clinical Staging (AJCC, 8th ed.): T0 N2-3 Note: Cigar and pipe tobacco consumption is not included in calculating the lifetime pack-years. Marijuana consumption is likewise not considered in this calculation. There is also no clear scientific evidence regarding the role of chewing tobacco-containing products in oropharyngeal cancer, although this is possibly more concerning given the proximity of the oral cavity and oropharynx. In any case, investigators should not count use of non-cigarette tobacco products in the pack-years calculation.\n\n    * Age \\>= 18\n    * Zubrod (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \\[ECOG\\]) performance status of 0-1 within 14 days prior to registration\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500 cells/mm\\^3 (within 30 days prior to registration)\n    * Platelets \\>= 75,000 cells/mm\\^3 (within 30 days prior to registration)\n    * Hemoglobin \\>= 8.0 g/dL (within 30 days prior to registration)\n\n      * Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin \\[Hgb\\] \\>= 8.0 g/dL is acceptable)\n    * Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \\>= 50 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (within 30 days prior to registration)\n    * Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 30 days prior to registration) (not applicable to patients with known Gilbert's syndrome)\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 1.5 x institutional ULN (within 30 days prior to registration)\n    * Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months and CD4 T Cell count \\> 200 cells/mm\\^3 are eligible for this trial. Testing is not required for entry into protocol\n    * Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n    * Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in persons of childbearing potential) within 14 days prior to registration. Childbearing potential is defined as any person who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes\n    * Willing to use highly effective contraceptives for participants of childbearing potential (participants who may become pregnant or who may impregnate a partner) during therapy and for 14 months (females); for 11 months (males) following last dose of cisplatin; this inclusion is necessary because the treatment in this study may be significantly teratogenic.\n    * The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with

months\n  * Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n  * New York Heart Association Functional Classification III/IV (Note: Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.)\n  * Persistent grade 3-4 (CTCAE version 5.0) electrolyte abnormalities that cannot be reversed despite replacement as indicated by repeat testing\n  * Patient must not have an active infection requiring IV antibiotics prior to registration;\n  * Other chronic renal disease like nephrotic syndrome, that could be worsened by cisplatin therapy\n  * History of allogenic organ transplantation\n  * Any symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy grade \\>= 2 (CTCAE version 5.0);\n* Pregnancy and individuals unwilling to discontinue nursing\n* History of hypersensitivity to cisplatin or platinum-containing
