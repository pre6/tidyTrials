Evaluate the feasibility of a real-world chemoprevention agent (CPA) intervention (3-months of daily low-dose acetylsalicylic (ASA)) in participants at increased risk for CRC (one or more high-risk adenomas removed during colonoscopy) based on participant uptake, adherence (days taking CPA), and adverse events;\n2. Evaluate factors related to uptake and adherence of ASA using validated surveys and interviews.","detailedDescription":"Study Design and Duration:\n\nThis is a single arm (non-randomized), open-label prospective cohort pilot study.\n\nScreening Phase: up to 2 weeks Treatment Phase: 90 days Follow-up Phase: 90 days\n\nScreening Phase: up to 14 days. Participants will consent to being enrolled in the study and to the use of ASA for a 90 day period. Regardless of agreement to use ASA for the entire study period, all participants will complete 6 baseline questionnaires.\n\nActive Treatment Phase: up to 90 days. Participants that agree to the use of ASAs will be instructed to take daily ASAs for 90 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone at 1, 2, and 3 months to determine adverse events, adherence, and discontinuation. At 3 months participants will fill out a chemoprevention questionnaire and the Adherence Barriers Questionnaire (ABQ).\n\nFollow-up Phase: 90 days. During the follow-up phase, participants will not be provided with ASA through the study nor will a specific recommendation be made to continue ASA. All participants will be contacted via telephone at the end of this period to determine the prevalence of continued use of ASA on their own.\n\nTotal study commitment will be up to 194 days. After consent, participants complete a 90 day active treatment phase followed by a 90 day follow-up phase.

In the past, 111In-octreotide imaging has been used for this purpose but it has been recently supplanted globally by SSR positron emission tomography (PET) imaging due to better image quality and higher diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThis study will assess the safety and diagnostic effectiveness of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE produced a the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre (ERC).","detailedDescription":"A single centre non-randomized, non-blinded phase II prospective cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging in patients with known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumors.\n\nUp to 600 scans will be included over 6 years. All patient ages (pediatric and adult) will be included. Individual patients may have more than one scan during the study period.\n\nSafety evaluation will consist of an adverse event assessment whil in the Nuclear Medicine department at the University of Alberta Hospital.

It also tests whether combination of selinexor and standard radiation therapy works to shrink tumors in this patient population. Glioma is a type of cancer that occurs in the brain or spine. Glioma is considered high risk (or high-grade) when it is growing and spreading quickly. The term, risk, refers to the chance of the cancer coming back after treatment. DIPG is a subtype of HGG that grows in the pons (a part of the brainstem that controls functions like breathing, swallowing, speaking, and eye movements). This trial has two parts. The only difference in treatment between the two parts is that some subjects treated in Part 1 may receive a different dose of selinexor than the subjects treated in Part 2. In Part 1 (also called the Dose-Finding Phase), investigators want to determine the dose of selinexor that can be given without causing side effects that are too severe. This dose is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2 (also called the Efficacy Phase), investigators want to find out how effective the MTD of selinexor is against HGG or DIPG. Selinexor blocks a protein called CRM1, which may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It is a type of small molecule inhibitor called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. The combination of selinexor and radiation therapy may be effective in treating patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG and H3 K27M-Mutant HGG.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To define toxicities and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor administered as an oral formulation in combination with standard of care radiation therapy (RT), to pediatric patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). (Dose-finding phase/phase I) II. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) distribution for diffuse midline glioma (DMG)/HGG patients and overall survival (OS) distribution for DIPG patients associated with selinexor plus RT, followed by selinexor in patients with newly diagnosed HGG (H3 K27M mutant DMG or H3 K27-wild type HGG) or DIPG, and to compare those outcomes to historical controls. (Efficacy phase/phase II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To bank tumor specimens and body fluids (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) for future studies.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of selinexor followed by a phase II study.

Based on the experience with other B-cells depleting agents, it is expected that the platelet counts will increase following a standard treatment. Each participant in cohort 1 will receive 1 subcutaneous injection of dose 1 every month for 3 months during the 12-week treatment period. And each participant in cohorts 2 and 3 will receive 1 subcutaneous injection of dose 2 or 3 every month for 4 months during the 16-week treatment period.

However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream represents a highly specific and sensitive approach (especially with serial monitoring) for identifying microscopic or residual tumor cells in colon cancer patients and may outperform traditional clinical and pathological features in prognosticating risk for recurrence. Colon cancer patients who do not have detectable ctDNA (ctDNA-) are at a much lower risk of recurrence and may not need adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, for colon cancer pts with detectable ctDNA (ctDNA+) who are at a very high risk of recurrence, the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen has not been established.
