To further reduce the treatment and adherence gaps in diabetes care, the researchers propose to evaluate a Customized, Continuous Care Management (CCCM) program that actively supports a partnership between the patient and his/her multidisciplinary care management (CM) team using an online disease management (ODM) system, which is integrated with a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) system that includes a personal health record and secure patient-clinician messaging capabilities. The CCCM program builds upon CM strategies proven effective in past studies and creates an ODM system that is built upon and fully integrated with a leading, commercially available EHR product - providing a blueprint for instituting customized, continuous care management for many different chronic conditions in a range of ambulatory care settings."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Diabetes","Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring","Home Blood Glucose Monitoring","Internet","Personal Health Record (PHR)","Health Information Technology (HIT)","Care management","Disease Management","Diabetes self-management","Consumer Health Information","Medical Records Systems, Computerized","Computerized Medical Records System","Automated Medical Records System","Electronic Health Record (EHR)","Remote patient monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":415,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Online disease management","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The PAMFOnline-mediated Personalized Health Care Program, which couples a multidisciplinary diabetes care management team with an EHR-integrated Online Disease Management (ODM) system.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Online disease management"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual medical care.

Aim2Be is an app for 10 to 17 year olds and their families that is intended to help them shift from an healthy lifestyle toward better health habits in four areas: nutrition, physical activity, recreational screen time, and sleep. This second evaluation has the following aims to: 1) describe reach; 2) assess change in knowledge of Canadian health recommendations; and 3) assess change in lifestyle behaviours and weight outcomes and whether these changes are moderated by involvement in the app. This study uses a two-group parallel/crossover randomized controlled trial design following N=200 families for six months.","detailedDescription":"Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT v2) is an engaging online, individualized, gamified lifestyle management program for youth, delivered through the Aim2Be app. LiGHT v2 is focused on initiating long-term behaviour change in youth and their families in order to help them shift from an unhealthy lifestyle toward better health habits in four areas: nutrition, physical activity, recreational screen time, and sleep. The program aims to support healthy lifestyles of 10- to 17-year-old children and adolescents, as well as to mitigate increased risk for metabolic and non-metabolic complications associated with obesity in the short and long term.\n\nThe app includes content that involve the family, and focus on behavioural therapy as well as dietary and physical activity patterns. Aim2Be is intended to be engaging and fun, provide virtual and tangible rewards, interact with participants multiple times per day, and provide a mobile social support network.\n\nPre-teens (10-13) and teens (14-17) will each have their own unique versions of Aim2Be. Content will be tailored specifically to the developmental stage and needs of each age group. The content will be delivered in such a way that it facilitates education, peer-to-peer conversation, and self-regulation in an engaging platform.\n\nBecause parents have been shown to be of primary importance in supporting healthy lifestyles of children, LiGHT v2 will educated and engage parents as well as youth. Parents will receive separate, but complementary content, intended to guide them as they shop for and prepare food and make behavioural changes within their families. The content for parents will be delivered using the same social aspects of Aim2Be as the pre-teens and teens, but the channels will be gated, so teens and parents each have their own space. Aim2Be's social features will help parents strategize and empathize with other families who wish to adopt healthy lifestyles.\n\nThe program will be evaluated using three separate study groups. This protocol describes the second of the three.\n\nFamilies (one parent and one child) will be recruited through advertising on social media and through active referral from six Canadian Pediatric Weight Management Registry (CANPWR) sites (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, SickKids, McMaster Children's Hospital, Stollery Children's Hospital, Alberta Children's Hospital, and British Columbia Children's Hospital). Approximately 350 families will be recruited and a total of 200 families will be enrolled into the study and randomized into two groups. This study uses a two-group parallel/crossover randomized controlled trial design. All families will be given access to Aim2Be v2.2 to use from their mobile device or home computer. Participants will be prospectively followed for six months.\n\nOnce participants are deemed eligible to participate in the study and complete their baseline assessments, they are allocated to one of two conditions: 1) Live Coach; or 3) waitlist control group given standard of care. Participants in the Live Coach group will be given access to Aim2Be for six months with a live coach who has expertise in supporting lifestyle modification and will help youth and parents set goals and achieve these goals using principles from motivational interviewing. Participants in the control group will be wait listed for enrollment in the app for three months and will be given access to the Virtual Coach version of the app after they complete the three month evaluation. The Virtual Coach group version provides automated guidance from a virtual coach instead of a live person, but that is programmed using the same motivational interviewing principles.\n\nEvaluation at baseline, three months, and six months will be used to compare whether those assigned to the different coach conditions have better health outcomes than those assigned to the waitlist control group. Parents will complete questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months, which assess sociodemographics, behaviours, and mediators of behaviour change. Youth will complete questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months, which assess health behaviours, mediators of behaviour change, and knowledge of Canadian recommendations for healthy behaviours. Questionnaire data will be collected and managed using REDCap.\n\nFamilies will be provided with a Fitbit, scale, and measuring tape when they enroll in the study. At each assessment point (baseline, three months, and six months), parents will provide youth's height and weight, and youth will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls and wear the Fitbit for the duration of the study.\n\nHonoraria will be paid at each time point to compensate participation.\n\nParticipants will be randomly allocated to each of the two groups and have equal likelihood of assignment to each condition. Participants will not be blinded as the design of the intervention does not facilitate this. Participants will be informed of their allocation after completing all baseline measures. Evaluators and researchers will be blinded to allocation during data analysis.\n\nThe aims of this study are to: 1) determine reach/ who participates in this study (short term outcome); 2) determine whether participation in the program increases adolescents' knowledge of Canadian health recommendations related to dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour (medium term outcome); and 3) assess the impact of Aim2Be on changes in dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours as well as Body Mass Index (BMI) and whether the impact is moderated by involvement in the app (long term outcome)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity, Pediatric"],"keywords":["obesity","physical activity","nutrition","adolescents","gamification","video game","sedentary activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aim2Be Live Coach","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Aim2Be app with Live Coach + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aim2Be app with Live Coach + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools"]},{"label":"Aim2Be Waitlist","type":"OTHER","description":"Aim2Be app waitlist + Canadian Health Recommendations + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools for three months, then flip to Aim2Be app with Virtual Coach + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aim2Be app waitlist + Canadian Health Recommendations + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools, then flip to Aim2Be app with Virtual Coach + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Aim2Be app with Live Coach + Fitbit + BMI tracking tools","description":"Participants will spend six months using the Aim2Be app setting aims, completing tasks, accessing articles, doing self-assessments, and participating in the social wall.

This trial is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).","detailedDescription":"While inflammation contributes crucially to atherothrombosis, it is unknown whether inhibition of inflammation per se will lower vascular event rates. The primary aim of the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) is to directly test the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis by evaluating whether or not low-dose methotrexate (LDM) will reduce rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death among stable coronary artery disease patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, conditions associated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory response. CIRT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, event-driven trial that will randomize 7,000 men and women from the United States and Canada. Following a five- to six-week open-label run-in (maximum 8 weeks), eligible participants who have either suffered documented myocardial infarction in the past or have angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease in the past will be randomly allocated over a three to four year period to usual care plus placebo or usual care plus LDM. The target methotrexate dose among those allocated to active therapy is 15 to 20 mg po per week, a dose within the range of that commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. All study participants will additionally receive 1.0 mg oral folate to be taken daily six days per week. LDM complications will be minimized through education programs for all investigators and coordinators, through enhanced communication with study participants, by limiting enrollment to those with no evidence of malignancy, hepatitis, renal dysfunction, chronic infection, pulmonary disease, or other risk factors for toxicity; by conducting an initial 5- to 6-week active-therapy run-in (maximum 8 weeks) designed to eliminate individuals who are either intolerant of or unable to adhere to treatment before randomization; and through regular monitoring of liver function and hematologic indices using a centralized methodology designed to ensure participant safety, allow for dose adjustments while maintaining the study blind, and provide an efficient method to address issues of compliance and follow-up on a cost-effective centralized basis. The primary trial endpoint is the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Secondary and tertiary endpoints include all-cause mortality, coronary revascularization, incident congestive heart failure, incident peripheral artery disease, incident venous thrombosis, clinically significant aortic stenosis, incident atrial fibrillation, incident diabetes among those with metabolic syndrome but not diabetes at study entry, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control among those with diabetes at study entry. The trial is event driven such that in the absence of extreme effects, the trial will conclude after accrual of at least 530 primary endpoints, an effect estimated to provide 90 percent power to detect a 25 percent relative risk reduction. The potential clinical impact of CIRT is broad as it has sufficient power to directly address core issues in the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis, and thus, if successful, will open major new directions for cardiovascular treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Disease"],"keywords":["Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Cardiovascular death","Type 2 Diabetes","Metabolic Syndrome","Cardiovascular Inflammation","Atherothrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4786,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Methotrexate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Methotrexate: Tablet, Oral, Target dose 15-20mg weekly plus 1.0 mg folic acid 6 days/week","interventionNames":["Drug: Methotrexate"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo: Tablet, Oral weekly plus 1.0mg folic acid 6 days/week","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Methotrexate","description":"Tablet, Oral, Target dose 15-20 mg weekly plus 1.0 mg folic acid 6 days/week","armGroupLabels":["Methotrexate"],"otherNames":["Trexall, TEVA Inc (brand of methotrexate)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Tablet, Oral, weekly plus 1.0 mg folic acid 6 days/week","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events","description":"The first occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event which is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following: Cardiovascular Death, Non-Fatal Myocardial Infarction or Non-Fatal Stroke.","timeFrame":"From randomization to trial end (April 2, 2018) up to a maximum of 5 years"},{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event or Hospitalization for Unstable Angina That Led to Urgent Coronary Revascularization","description":"The first occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event or Hospitalization for Unstable Angina that led to Urgent Coronary Revascularization.","timeFrame":"From randomization to trial end (April 2, 2018) - up to a maximum of 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Subjects With All-cause Mortality","description":"Subjects who died from any cause.","timeFrame":"From randomization to the trial end (April 2, 2018) up to a maximum of 5 years"},{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event or Any Coronary Revascularization","description":"The first occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event or Any Coronary Revascularization.","timeFrame":"From randomization to the trial end (April 2, 2018) - up to a maximum of 5 years"},{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure","description":"The first occurrence of Hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure","timeFrame":"From randomization to trial end (April 2, 2018) up to a maximum of 5 years"},{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event, Coronary Revascularization, Hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure or All Cause Mortality","description":"The first occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event, Coronary Revascularization, Hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure or All Cause Mortality.","timeFrame":"From randomization to trial end (April 2, 2018) up to a maximum of 5 years"},{"measure":"Number of Subjects With New Onset Type 2 Diabetes","description":"New onset type 2 diabetes among those without diabetes at baseline.

Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland as a response to the production of corticotropin (ACTH) in the pituitary gland.\n\nBetween 10% and 20% of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome) have ectopic production of the hormone ACTH. Meaning, the hormone is not being released from the normal site, the pituitary gland. In many cases the ectopic ACTH is being produced by a tumor of the lung, thymus, or pancreas. However, in approximately 50% of these patients the source of the ACTH cannot be found even with the use of extensive imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear scans (111-indium pentetreotide). The ability of these tests to locate the source of the hormone production is dependent on the changes of anatomy and / or the dose and adequate uptake of the radioactive agent. The inability to detect the source of ectopic ACTH production often results in unnecessary pituitary surgery or irradiation.\n\nUnlike the previously described tests, positron emission tomography (PET scan) has the ability to detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the abnormal tissue.\n\nThis study will test whether fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), fluorine-18-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA) or use of a higher dose of 111-indium pentetreotide can be used to successfully localize the source of ectopic ACTH production.","detailedDescription":"Between 10 percent and 20 percent of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) have ectopic production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that causes cortisol excess. In approximately 50 percent of these patients, the source of ACTH cannot be found despite very detailed and extensive examination including imaging studies such as computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreotide scan (octreoscan) using the conventional low dose of indium-111 pentetreotide. The sensitivity and specificity of these imaging studies depends on anatomic alterations and/or the dose and adequate uptake of radiopharmaceutical. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) has the ability to detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the abnormal tissue. This protocol tests whether fluorine-18 dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA) or use of a higher dose of indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan) can be used to localize successfully the source of ectopic ACTH production. In addition the study examines whether administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone can improved the sensitivity of the standard dose Octreoscan. Eligible patients participating in this arm of the study will have a second standard dose scan. Others will receive a higher dose octreoscan instead."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cushing Syndrome","Endocrine Disease"],"keywords":["PET","fluorine -18(18F)-DOPA","Pentetreotide","ACTH","Octreotide","Cushing's Syndrome","Ectopic Cushing Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Comparison of results in patients receiving similar imaging scans","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":95,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with Cushing Syndrome","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive various types of radiologic or nuclear medicine scans to identify tumor","interventionNames":["Drug: Pentetreotide","Drug: 18F-DOPA","Device: CT scan","Device: MRI","Drug: 18-FDG"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pentetreotide","description":"Binds primarily to the somatostatin receptors subtypes (sst) 2 and 5.

Patients are adults with possible ectopic Cushing syndrome. Since both men and women are affected with ectopic Cushing syndrome, both sexes are studied. All ethnic and racial groups are at risk and will be included. Patients must be willing to return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for follow-up studies.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPregnant or lactating women. A pregnancy test is performed in women of childbearing potential (up to age 55) unless they have a history of hysterectomy.\n\nChildren (age less than18) are excluded. Because ectopic ACTH secretion is rare in this age group, the likelihood of benefit is less and does not balance the risk of radiation.\n\nPatients taking medications that alter CYP3A4 activity will not be eligible for the mifepristone study, since this P450 system metabolizes mifepristone. Such participants would receive a clinical high dose (18 mCi) octreoscan (H-OCT) instead, if the standard 6 mCi octreoscan (L-OCT) was negative. Patients with hypokalemia (K \\< 3.5 milliequivalent (mEq)/L) despite medical therapy with replacement or mineralocorticoid antagonists will also be excluded from the mifepristone studies.\n\nThe presence of:\n\n* severe active infection.\n* clinically significantly impaired cardiovascular (e.g., history of abnormally low ejection fraction, the presence of moderate pulmonary fluid overload or leg edema, and blood pressure over 190/100), abnormal coagulation (partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time elevated by 30 percent above the normal values), hematopoietic (hematocrit less than 30 percent, hemoglobin below 10 g/dl, white count below 3000 K/microliter (UL), and platelets below 100,000 K/mm(3)), hepatic (liver enzymes elevated by 3-fold above normal values) or renal function (plasma creatinine level over 2.0).\n* impaired mental capacity or markedly abnormal psychiatric evaluation that precludes informed consent.\n* body weight over 136 kg, which is the limit for the tables used in the scanning areas.\n* combined blood withdrawal, during the six weeks preceding the study, of greater than 450 ml.\n* known allergy to 111-indium pentetreotide or other somatostatin analogues.\n* strong evidence for Cushing disease.

A major objective will be to translate the clinical and fundamental based discoveries into new diagnosis and preventive actions paving the way to novel modes of treatment in the successive stages of CMD progression.","detailedDescription":"Cardiovascular diseases represent a huge medico-economic issue that is supported by public health policy. It is linked not only to the high prevalence of these diseases but also the associated cost they encounter for. Therefore, it seems rather urgent to create and validate tools to predict evolution of this group of disease in order to better take care of patients before they enter the more chronic stages which induce increased costs and socioeconomic and medical burdens.\n\nIt is now well acknowledged that gut microbiota is modified in some metabolic disease such as type-2 diabetes but also in inflammatory diseases. However, gut microbiota is still insufficiently explored in cardiovascular disease, although it could represent a useful, non-invasive and practical tool in the daily care of patients.\n\nInvestigators aim to deepen the knowledge and characterization of gut microbiota in patients going from metabolic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, obesity and type 2 diabetes (which are risks factors for cardiovascular diseases) to overt coronary artery diseases (from the first event to end stage heart failure). Investigators will use a system medicine approach whose aim is to integrate numerous data coming from different technologies (including environment, transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, lipidomics and bioinformatics). These integrated approaches are needed to translate basic science findings into clinical practice for the benefit of the patients.\n\nInvestigators aim to uncover new microbial signatures that could help diagnose and/or predict both the natural evolution of cardiometabolic diseases and the response to treatment. Investigators aim to go forward personalized medicine.\n\nPatients will be approached for enrolment during their hospitalization in the 3 centers during the 24-month enrolment phase (WP3). Once the informed consent completed, each patient will be assessed for CMD phenotypes including clinical examination, environmental and food habit evaluation, blood urine and feces samples. In each group of patients, a sub-sample of 30 to 50 subjects will be included in one or more advanced phenotyping items. This will include whole body composition by absorptiometry (DXA), abdominal visceral fat by tomodensitometry, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) (glucose, insulin, incretins), subcutaneous fat biopsy, cardiac echocardiography, intima media thickness, pulse wave velocity. For the obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery: liver and subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue biopsies will be obtained during surgery.\n\nThis group of patient will be followed at 3, 6 and 12 months after their surgery and will have the same examination as mentioned above."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiometabolic Disease"],"keywords":["Obesity","Type 2 diabetes","Coronary

Maternal metabolic profiles and infant growth will be assessed at randomization and at one year postpartum.","detailedDescription":"Impaired glucose metabolism (gestational diabetes (GDM) and mild hyperglycemia) that occurs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complications and is also an early indication of long-term metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the US, GDM is diagnosed using a two-step screening and diagnostic approach. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) proposed a one-step diagnostic approach that broadens the definition of GDM by lowering the cutoff values to include women with milder forms of hyperglycemia, who would have screened normal under the current two-step approach. The goal of these recommendations is better identification of women at risk for pregnancy complications and long-term metabolic dysfunction, but it results in a significant increase in the prevalence of GDM. The NIH GDM Consensus Development Conference committee does not recommend changing from the current two-step screening/diagnostic approach to the IADPSG one-step diagnostic approach without trials demonstrating that increasing the number of women diagnosed as having GDM results in better outcomes. We aim to 1) conduct a \"real world\" randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine differences in short-term perinatal health outcomes between the two predominant GDM screening approaches, and 2) prospectively follow the mothers to examine their metabolic risk profiles and the growth of their infants at 1 year postpartum. Based on a pilot study, we propose a single site blinded RCT of 920 pregnant women ages 18-45 years without a diagnosis of diabetes, with a singleton pregnancy (18-24 wks gestation). Participants will have a non-fasting 1 hour 50 gm glucose challenge test (GCT) performed between 24-28 weeks' gestation. Women with 50 gm GCT results \\< 200 mg/dL will be randomized to receive either a fasting 2 hour 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a 3 hour 100 gm OGTT. GDM will be diagnosed using the IADPSG criteria for women receiving the 75 gm OGTT and Carpenter-Coustan criteria for women receiving the 100 gm. Participants and their physicians will be informed of the diagnosis of GDM, but blinded to the specific test results and diagnostic criteria. Participants with GDM will receive treatment from their primary provider. Questionnaires will be used to assess participants' and physicians' views on GDM testing. Metabolic profiles will be assessed at randomization and at a year postpartum. The primary outcome measure is large-for-gestational age fetal growth. The rationale for this RCT is that this is a unique opportunity to compare the two methods. At the end of the study, we will know whether women diagnosed at lower glucose levels with the IADPSG criteria are more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes. We hypothesize that using IADPSG diagnostic criteria will result in greater detection of women with impaired glucose metabolism and treating these women will reduce adverse perinatal outcomes and prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction. This study will provide level A data for endorsing universal screening guidelines for GDM by major organizations and implementation into clinical care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gestational Diabetes","Pregnancy","Glucose Intolerance"],"keywords":["gestational diabetes screening","Carpenter Coustan Criteria","IADPSG criteria","Large for gestational age birth weight"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":921,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"3 hour 100 gm OGTT (CC Criteria)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Gestational diabetes screening with fasting 3 hour 100 gm.

CGM use has been endorsed for individuals with T1D by the American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society, and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes. Despite these recommendations and the compelling evidence of the benefits of CGM, many individuals with T1D or insulin-using T2D have not incorporated CGM into their diabetes management.\n\nThe study was designed to assess feasibility and efficacy of establishing a virtual diabetes clinic with a focus on introduction and training related to use of CGM technology and ongoing CGM use to minimize such rate-limiting factors as geography, cost and access to specialty care. The virtual diabetes clinic model included a comprehensive care team with support for diabetes technology such as CGM and decision support to align with current recommendations in diabetes care. The virtual diabetes clinic model also included mental health screening and support services, particularly for diabetes-related issues."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes","Type 2 Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":235,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"All Participants","type":"OTHER","description":"All participants were provided with a commercially available CGM system.

It will be conducted in four centres in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. The primary outcome measures will be determining the frequency of good fetomaternal and neonatal outcome through glycemic control. Target of Glycemic Status: For Pregnant Mother, Fasting, 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), Two-hour postprandial,120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L), For Neonate glycemic status at or above 2.5 mmol/l. Maternal outcome during pregnancy - Decrease chance of antenatal infections that is Vulvovaginitis and recurrent UTI, Decrease pre-eclampsia, Decrease Antepartum Hemorrhage and Polyhydramnios. Maternal outcome in the form of mode of safe delivery- Increase frequency of vaginal delivery, Decrease chance of obstructed labour. Maternal outcome after delivery- Decrease chance of Postpartum Hemorrhage, Decrease chance of puerperal sepsis. Fetal Outcome- Less chance of Intra uterine death and prematurity. Neonatal Outcome- Less chance of Birth injury, Birth asphyxia, Perinatal death, Good Apgar score (≥ 7) in 1st and 5th minute, Less need for NICU care and Less chance of macrosomia (≥ 4 kg) at term. Fewer proportion of patients will require insulin to manage GDM. The secondary outcomes will be patient satisfaction and the patient will be a future resource person.","detailedDescription":"Procedure of Study (Including methods of intervention, measurement, estimation etc.):\n\nScreen positive GDM patients will be recruited according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After taking consent they will be registered for study purpose. According to computer generated randomization the health centres will be allocated and single method of management either patient empowerment or conventional method will be adopted for the whole cluster of the respective health centre. The intervention group will only receive the \"Patient Empowerment' package.\n\nThe patients of intervention group, along with antenatal check-up, will go through the first session of the empowerment package on the first day of recruitment. Then they will be evaluated through structured questions to know their level of perception/ understanding and retention about the diabetes and its management. Those who will perform to get at least 80% out of 100 will be recognized as empowered. Who fail to achieve that they will be called for next seating. Patients unwilling to go through the process or failed to achieve the targeted score within three seating will be excluded. Those who fulfilled the target, they will be advised to follow the calorie and diet distribution schedule. They will be advised to return back 2 days later, with the blood sugar chart (6 times per day) by SMBG (Self-monitoring of blood glucose). The respondents will get the materials like measuring cup, hand manuals on diabetes, glucometer and chart for record keeping.\n\nAfter evaluating the sugar chart, if they are found poor performer they will be counselled and trained further and will have to come back again after two days. At the same time patient's satisfaction will be assessed with LIKERT scale. Frequency of further visit will depend on patient's performance.\n\nAll the respondents from both groups are supposed to come for ANC at least at monthly interval initially up to 28 weeks and then fortnightly up to 36 weeks and then weekly up to delivery; frequency of the visit may be more if necessary. For Conventional (non- intervention) group at least 2 to 3 times blood sugar level should be checked within the follow up period. Then all the pertinent variables will be recorded, analyzed as per study objective and outcome, to evaluate the effectiveness of patient empowerment in the management of GDM.\n\nBlood sample collection:\n\nPatients of GDM will be trained to measure their own blood sugar level (both fasting and 2 hours' postprandial) by Glucometer at home and to maintain a blood sugar chart.\n\nLaboratory methods:\n\nIn this study design apart from routine antenatal screening tests no other additional laboratory investigation will be done unless be otherwise needed on medical ground.\n\nFollow up of the patients:\n\nBoth the study group and comparison group will be followed up as per study protocol at monthly interval initially up to 28 weeks and then fortnightly up to 36 weeks and then weekly up to delivery; frequency of the visit may be more if necessary.\n\nData Collection Tools:\n\nPre-tested semi structured questionnaire/interview schedule and checklist.\n\nData Collection Procedure:\n\nGDM cases will be enrolled in this study with taking written consent on the consent form. Data will be collected by multiple techniques like face to face interview, records, findings of physical examination and observation, information on concerned variables and will be documented. Among the variables the fasting blood sugar and 2 hours after ingestion of 75-gram glucose will be considered as baseline for detection of GDM as screening test between 14 to 34 weeks of gestation. Patient empowerment\n\nAll the clinical and investigative findings and therapeutic variables will be documented during each antenatal visit. The ANC and its frequency should be according to conventional schedule (Monthly up to 28 weeks, fortnightly up to 36 weeks and then weekly up to delivery in low risk cases and for high risk the frequency of visit will be more). In both the groups from patient's blood sugar chart, average blood sugar value will be documented monthly. Each patient will be followed up to the end of puerperium that is 6 weeks after delivery.\n\nFrom each institute, data will be collected with separate registration name and number and will be stored separately.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nThe data will be analyzed according to cluster randomized trial protocol; and all statistical analysis will be based on Intention to Treat (ITT) approach. Descriptive statistics will be generated for all base line and follow-up data (frequency and relative frequency for categorical data, means with standard deviations (SDs) or 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for normally distributed continuous data and for non-normal data median and interquartile ranges.\n\nUnivariable associations between baseline patient characteristics and outcome will be assessed using univariable Cox regression. All statistically significant predictors will be assessed for possible confounding. Potential confounders measured at baseline will be selected based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and univariate association finding. Tests based on Schoenfeld residuals will be used to identify violations of the proportional hazards assumption. Impact of intervention on for primary outcome (adverse pregnancy outcome) will be assessed using multilevel cox proportional hazard regression adjusting for plausible confounders. Multilevel modelling will include a shared frailty term in the model to account for hospital-level clustering. The between-group differences will be assessed enabling simultaneous examination of cluster and individual-level influences on outcomes. Adjustment of the result for between-cluster variation will thus be achieved. The effects of the intervention on maternal and neonatal outcomes and changes in physical activity and diet will be analysed by using generalized linear latent and mixed models and multilevel mixed-effects linear regression by fitting random effects models. All analysis will be performed in Stata S/E version 17.\n\nQuality assurance strategy:\n\nFrom research team, PI, Co-PI and other investigators and local GOB health managers will work together for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. They will jointly monitor the progress and oversee any deviation from the protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"At the end of the study, the outcome will be assessed by blinded.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":459,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Empowerment Model","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be empowered to manage gestational diabetes mellitus themselves by acquiring knowledge and skill to monitor blood sugar levels, adjusting meals and daily activities.","interventionNames":["Other: Patient Empowerment model"]},{"label":"Standard of care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients will get the conventional way of management where patients get advice about a diet chart with a fixed menu and injection of insulin to control blood sugar levels."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Patient Empowerment model","description":"Session I\n\n* Knowledge about the disease, calories \\& diet distribution, physical activities, symptoms of hypoglycemia, Blood Glucose target etc.\n* Training on use of glucometer and record keeping Session II\n* Evaluation and interpretation of sugar level based on the sugar chart.\n* Tuning of diet and exercise if needed.\n* Discussion about the challenges faced by the patient during maintenance of sugar level.\n\nSession III \\& ongoing\n\n* Tuning of the diet based on calories, evaluation of the understanding\n* Assessment of patient satisfaction\n* Assessment of patients' knowledge and skill to designate her as \"Empowered\"\n\nAssurance and counseling of patient and family will be rendered in each session.","armGroupLabels":["Patient Empowerment Model"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with adverse maternal pregnancy outcome","description":"Maternal pregnancy outcome are antenatal infection, Preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, Ante and post partum Haemorrhage, Puerperal sepsis.

In the United States alone, a recent study predicts that over half of the population will have obesity in 2030. At the global level, overweight and obesity are also estimated to account for 44% of diabetes, 23% of heart disease and between 7% to 41% of cancer cases, in addition to numerous other pathologies, including neurological disorders. While obesity and overweight are classified as a general disease (i.e. a body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2, respectively), there are large variabilities between classifications of obesity observed. For example, sub-populations of obesity present either a rapid or delayed onset of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany studies show that lifestyle interventions are effective in improving overweight and obesity through weight loss, but with very large inter-individual variability, especially in the long-term. These interventions and the respective observed weight loss are also shown to reduce the risk of other cardiovascular or metabolic diseases, demonstrating the importance of weight loss for future quality of life Interestingly, there is a large variation in weight loss when implementing the same dietary or lifestyle changes, even when many factors are accounted for in clinical studies. Similar variable weight loss or metabolic responses are also observed for other obesity treatments, such as pharmaceutical or surgical interventions. Therefore, in order to prevent and treat overweight and obesity, it is critical to progress in the understanding of individual variations in responses (trajectories) to weight loss programs.\n\nWhile biological, environmental, and behavioral factors indeed drive personal responses, recent advances have allowed more insight into how the human body processes these stimuli, namely through microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. Over the last 10 years, the gut microbiota, the 100 billion bacterial cells inhabiting our intestines, has emerged as a recognized factor contributing to our health. Given its access to the food and medicine consumed by an individual, the gut microbiota can be seen as a \"super integrator\" highly sensitive to our environmental and lifestyle changes. Accumulating evidence has highlighted that the gut microbiota translates these environmental changes by altering its diversity of bacteria or functions and producing molecules that interact with organs and the brain.\n\nAs part of a weight loss program conducted within the standard of care in a network of clinical centers across France, the investigators set out to establish a cohort to examine the relative contribution of clinical, nutritional, and lifestyle factors related to individual's weight loss success with an emphasis on evaluating the gut microbiome of

The current classification criteria allow diagnosing the disease in its late course, when significant bony overgrowth already involves the vertebral column and the appendicular skeleton. The research of the pathogenic mechanisms in DISH, is significantly hampered by the late diagnosis resulting from this definition.Based on recent MRI studies in both axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and in DISH, it seems that changes similar to the classical early inflammatory changes described in axSpA, can be detected in patients with DISH. We therefore hypothesize, that patients with metabolic syndrome without radiographic evidence for spinal DISH, might exhibit early MRI changes. If this hypothesis proves to be correct, early diagnosis and research of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms at this early stage might be very rewarding in investigations of the early aberrations of the entheses homeostasis and eventually early, more targeted therapeutic interventions. The study will examine MRI changes in patients, in their 5th decade of life, with high risk for the development of DISH (ie diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome) compared with patients who don't have this risk.","detailedDescription":"Patient's selection- Patients will be recruited from obesity/metabolic/diabetes clinics and from bariatric surgeries clinics.

During the second phase, the implementation team will be responsible for structuring the actions for the implementation of the intervention, adapting it to the context defined in phase 1, developing strategies for the training of primary care workers. In phase 3, we will implement the intervention either using a software or a booklet for people with diabetes and we will monitor the participants' diabetes-related, functional and quality of life outcomes after the 12 weeks of intervention.

Prediabetes can be addressed using a public health approach: among the 20% of participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) who were ages 60 and over, the diet and physical activity intervention conferred a 71% risk reduction of diabetes after an average follow-up of 3 years. The population of older adults is projected to more than double from 52.5 million in 2019 to \\~100 million by 2060, and if projections hold, about half (48.3%) will have prediabetes. The proposed hybrid effectiveness implementation type 1 design will compare a DPP program Tailored for Older Adults and delivered via Telehealth (DPP-TOAT arm) to an in person DPP tailored for older adults (DPP arm) using a randomized, controlled trial design (n=230). The preliminary data suggests DPP-TOAT is a feasible and acceptable way to deliver the DPP to older adults, and this will be the first study to compare the effectiveness and implementation of two strategies (telehealth versus in-person) to deliver a tailored DPP for the unique needs of the growing population of older adults.","detailedDescription":"Eligible patients will be recruited through electronic health records (Epic and MyChart) and randomized to the 12-month DPP-TOAT or the in-person DPP program. Primary effectiveness outcome will be 6-month weight loss and implementation outcome will be attendance. A pragmatic approach will be used in order to inform future studies conducted in community-based and rural settings. Findings will inform best practices in the delivery of an evidence-based intervention that could reach the 30+ million adults aged 65 and over with

This study specifically aims to:\n\n1. Gain advanced skills in the development and implementation of novel culturally sensitive motivational strategies\n2. Acquire critical preliminary data for an R01-funded phase II efficacy trial testing the use of these motivational strategies to improve dialysis treatment adherence.","detailedDescription":"Hemodialysis treatment non-adherence is a public health issue because of its association with excessive hospitalizations, high morbidity, mortality, and increased financial costs. Compared to whites, African Americans have a four-fold higher prevalence of end stage kidney disease (EKSD), higher non-adherence rates to hemodialysis, and higher odds of hospitalizations. Motivational interviewing, an evidence-based intervention that creates a bond between patients and providers, targets improvement in motivation-related psychosocial factors associated with adherence behaviors. Interventions for such factors are typically developed based on the dominant culture and may not be valid and generalizable to minority groups. Culturally tailored interventions lead to more durable change in African Americans yet there is a lack of studies testing the efficacy of such approaches to improve hemodialysis treatment adherence in African Americans. Use of culturally tailored motivational interviewing in African Americans with ESKD will promote health equity by improving dialysis treatment adherence, reducing hospitalizations, and enhancing other critical outcomes.\n\nOur long-term goal is to establish culturally sensitive strategies and multi-level interactions to improve outcomes in kidney disease. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a culturally tailored motivational interviewing intervention developed using a rigorous theoretical framework on improving hemodialysis treatment adherence in African Americans with ESKD. The central hypothesis is that culturally tailored motivational interviewing will lead to improved hemodialysis treatment adherence. We will test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in African American patients with ESKD. Compared to usual dialysis care, we aim to: Evaluate the efficacy of 8 weeks of culturally tailored motivational interviewing (MoVE) on improving hemodialysis adherence at (1) 3 months, and (2) 6 months post-randomization. At the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes will include evidence of the efficacy of culturally tailored motivational interviewing on improving hemodialysis treatment adherence in African American patients with ESKD. The proposed research is innovative because of the novel application of a culturally tailored, evidence-based behavioral intervention developed using a rigorous theoretical network (PEN-3); the use of specifically-trained health coaches to optimize the intervention delivery; and the focus on understanding and overrepresented African American patients with ESKD to address the public health issue of hemodialysis treatment of non-adherence. Study results will provide a strong basis for conducting an effectiveness and implementation trial, which is expected to have a significant impact on hemodialysis adherence, hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality. This research strongly aligns with NIDDK's mission to promote health equity by addressing health disparities in kidney disease.\n\nHemodialysis treatment non-adherence is an important modifiable contributor to end stage kidney disease (ESKD), with critical public health relevance to patients, providers, and health systems due to its association with excessive hospitalizations, exorbitant financial burden, and increase morbidity and mortality. Compared to Whites, African Americans ESKD patients have a four-fold higher ESKD prevalence, persistently higher hospitalization and rehospitalization risk, and higher rates of dialysis treatment non-adherence. The goals of this proposal are to: (1) evaluate the efficacy of culturally tailored motivational interviewing on improving hemodialysis treatment adherence in African Americans; (2) provide a strong basis for conducting a future effectiveness and implementation trial using evidence-based, culturally tailored motivational interviewing intervention to improve hemodialysis adherence, and reduce hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality, and exorbitant financial burden associated with dialysis treatment non-adherence; and (3) promote health equity by reducing existing health disparities and optimizing outcomes in ESKD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["End Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis"],"keywords":["Dialysis treatment adherence; Hemodialysis; African American"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard of Care"},{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Motivational interviewing intervention","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motivational interviewing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motivational interviewing","description":"In this trial, motivational interviewing (MI) is the intervention.

This will be achieved by monitoring blood sugar levels when a regular dinner meal is given, when a liquid breakfast meal (BOOST Original containing 41 grams Carbohydrates (CHO), 4 grams fat, 10 grams protein) is given, when subcutaneous insulin is dosed to induce hypoglycemia to a goal of 55 mg/dL, and when a regular lunch meal is given. A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) is an electronic device that measures and displays blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body throughout the day and night. The method being used to detect blood sugar in the investigational Glucose Binding Protein-Based Continuous Glucose Monitor (GBP CGM) is different than the method that is currently in use by commercially available models.\n\nSome sensors cannot tell the difference between glucose (sugar) and other substances such as Tylenol, aspirin or citric acid etc. Because they cannot tell the difference, they may give false readings. The GBP CGM is made to only recognize glucose in the body rather than other substances (e.g., Tylenol, aspirin, citric acid, etc.). As a result, the investigators expect the new GBP CGM to be more accurate at detecting low blood sugar levels than the current devices.","detailedDescription":"Development of accurate continuous glucose monitoring devices is critically important for the maintenance of strict glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia and for the successful implementation of an artificial pancreas. Glucose binding protein-based (GBP) continuous glucose monitors offer several potential advantages over commercially available glucose oxidase based sensors. Unlike glucose oxidase based sensors, GBP sensors do not require establishment of an equilibrium reduction/oxidation reaction and are not as susceptible to interference from other compounds because they are engineered to recognize only glucose. As a result, GBP-based glucose sensors are exceptionally accurate at low blood glucose levels and have a faster warm-up time than glucose oxidase based systems. The principal idea of this proposal is to evaluate the accuracy and performance of a second generation glucose binding protein-based continuous glucose monitor (GBP CGM) developed by BD Technologies in subjects with type 1 diabetes, with emphasis on warm-up period after insertion, accuracy in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges, and lag time over a 24 hour period of sensor use. In order to accomplish this, the investigators will conduct a clinical trial consisting of 25.5-hour studies involving 15 subjects, each wearing one active and one mock (no GBP) device simultaneously during meals and induced hypoglycemia to observe a wide range of glucose values. The investigators envision that the glucose binding protein-based continuous glucose monitor will demonstrate minimal warm-up time after insertion, overall accuracy comparable to commercial glucose oxidase sensors with excellent performance in the hypoglycemic range and a nominal lag time to sensing a change in blood glucose."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Continuous Glucose Monitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GBP-CGM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will wear one active GBP-CGM and one inactive GBP-CGM","interventionNames":["Device: GBP CGM"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"GBP CGM","description":"Visit 1: Screening visit to determine if subject qualifies for the study.

Although dysfunctional, changes in BBB integrity for these conditions are thought to be subtle and close to intact values. Recent studies have shown it is possible measure small changes in the BBB integrity as an early sign of disease using DCE MRI. The objective of this study is to apply an optimized DCE imaging protocol and novel image post-processing to obtain new information about the BBB integrity in aging.

Accelerated re-epithelialization rate and minimizing pain and infection are main goals of donor care. Traditionally dressings are inexpensive but adhere to the wound surface and cannot absorb exudates. Thus, we have developed a new biomaterial based on Thai silk for wound dressing application. Silk fibroin and silk sericin were selected to produce wound dressing in this study. The objective of this study is to compare wound dressing containing silk fibroin with bioactive coating layer with standard dressing (medicated paraffin gauze dressing; Bactigras®), with regard to healing time, patients' pain intensity, skin's transepidermal water loss after healing and evidence of infection in the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor sites. The study design is a randomized, controlled, self paired clinical trial. Patients age 18 to 60 years and undergo STSG at thigh in Department of Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital will be recruited in the study. The exclusion criteria are donor sites other than thigh area or located at high risk of infection. Patients who are immunocompromised or diabetes mellitus or psychiatric disorders or low serum albumin level (less than 3.0 g/dL) or known allergic to SS or SF or paraffin or chlorhexidine acetate are also excluded. All subjects sign the informed consents after discussion the protocol, benefits and risks. The donor site will be divided into two equal halves, each site will be randomized to receive the tested material or the medicated paraffin gauze dressing. The donor site wounds will be observed daily. The dressings will not be changed, except when they are fully soaked with exudates and easily fell off or any sign of infection. Healing time will be recorded when the dressing separate completely from the donor site, no exudates and no pain when the donor site is exposed to air. The patient's pain level will be evaluated with the visual analogue scale and the donor site wounds will be observed daily for signs of infection. On the day of the wound is recorded for healing time and 1 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months after that, the skin barrier function (TEWL) of each site will be measured using a Tewameter. Blood sample will be collected from patients pre- and postoperatively (within day 3) for hepatic and renal function analysis.","detailedDescription":"1.

Air cannot pass through as it would in the awake state and thus airflow limitations occur. The person asleep might compensate the flow limitation by breathing faster, which causes the soft tissue to vibrate (= snoring). Further narrowing of the airways can lead to obstructive apneas (complete airway collapse and stopping of airflow). First line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway pressure (PAP) that keeps the airways open with a pneumatic splint. Since PAP involves wearing a facial mask that applies air pressure into the airways, some patients cannot tolerate this therapy. These patients might be candidates for an alternative treatment approach with a mandibular advancement device (MAD).","detailedDescription":"During sleep, the muscles in the oropharyngeal space relax, the tongue falls back and the volume of the pharynx decreases. Air cannot pass through as it would in the awake state and thus airflow limitations occur. Diminishing airflow can lead to snoring or to the airways collapsing completely (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA). Patients who suffer from OSA have trouble breathing during sleep and will have a disturbed sleep architecture as repeated airway closure causes wake reactions and arousals. This does not only lead to severe daytime sleepiness with high risk of causing car accidents, for instance, but also affects synaptic activity during sleep and the balance of blood gas levels. These factors can have a aggravating effect on blood pressure and worsen the prognosis for cardiovascular comorbidities. First line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway pressure (PAP) that keeps the airways open with a pneumatic splint. Positive airway pressure is being applied through a facial mask and some patients cannot tolerate this therapy or refuse it. An alternative treatment approach is by fitting an MAD that the patient wears during sleep. An MAD pushes the lower jar forward and thereby increases the volume of the upper airways, thus preventing them to close. Studies have shown good compliance with MAD therapy and benefits in terms of sleepiness and quality of life. The Narval registry study aims to investigate MAD usage in real life and reasons for non-compliance. The registry aims to record patient characteristics (e.g. comorbidities) and side effects that lead to a termination of therapy, but also how the costs for therapy are split between the patient and public or private health insurance providers and how this affects therapy initiation and usage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes of the Apnoea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) at baseline compared to a follow-up after 3 months","description":"Changes in the number of apnoeas (cessation of airflow) and hypopneas (reduced airflow) at baseline and at follow-up","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in sleep-related quality of life from baseline compared to 3 months follow-up","description":"Changes in sleep-related quality of life assessed with the questionnaire FOSQ (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire).

The findings would provide further insight into feasibility of standardizing RYGB limb lengths and optimizing resultant weight loss and metabolic effects. The investigators hypothesize RYGB with ratio-adjusted limb lengths (aRYGB) will result in higher total weight loss and resolution of metabolic syndrome comorbidities, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension compared to standard fixed-length RYGB (sRYGB). The study will also utilize the Short Form Rand 36-Item Health Survey (SF36) to determine differences in postoperative quality of life metrics.","detailedDescription":"This study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 recruitment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomized to Standard fixed-length RYGB (sRYGB) or ratio-adjusted limb lengths (aRYGB) once the total small bowel length (TSBL) is fully counted intraoperatively.\n\nsRYGB will serve as the control group which will utilize BP and roux limb lengths of 100cm and 100cm, respectively. For the treatment group, aRYGB will incorporate a BP limb length measuring 30% and a roux limb of 15% of total small bowel length each.\n\nOutcomes to be investigated:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine significantly increased Total Weight Loss (TWL) after aRYGB compared to sRYGB in morbidly obese patients Given current understanding that weight loss after RYGB is mediated, at least in part, by a malabsorptive process, the investigators hypothesize that TWL will be greater after aRYGB versus sRYGB. As per standard of care at our institute, routine postoperative follow-up in the multidisciplinary Bariatric clinic will occur every 6 months (± 14 days) or more frequently as clinically indicated for the first two years postoperatively followed by yearly thereafter. Weight will be recorded in kilograms and a BMI will be calculated by the ratio of patient weight in kilograms over patient height in meters squared. Postoperative TWL will then be measured postoperatively at 6, 12, 24, 60 months from surgery.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To compare rates of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) resolution between aRYGB Vs SRYGB by DM subgroup analysis Of the many metabolic changes that occur after bariatric surgery, one of the most salient effects include a rapid and effective resolution of DM. This has been extensively studied in context of various bariatric surgeries, including RYGB by our institution as previously described by the STAMPEDE trial. Significant reduction of HbA1C and improvement in insulin sensitivity was noted as early as six to 12 months postoperatively. As such, this study proposes measurement of the following two metrics at 6, 12, 24, 60 months postoperatively: 1) proportion of subjects achieving HbA1C less than or equal to 6.5%; and, 2) proportion of subjects able to wean and/or discontinue glycemic control medications.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To investigate the relative postoperative efficacy of aRYGB compared to sRYGB on alleviating metabolic syndrome in morbid obesity Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of diagnoses including Hypertension (HTN) and Hyperlipidemia (HLD), which posit significant risk of medical comorbidities such as DM, coronary disease, and strokes. As such, addressing these conditions in morbidly obese patients confers a significant health benefit and decreases overall morbidity.

Responses will be tracked and obtained preoperatively and at various postoperative time points including Post-Operative Day (POD) 30 (± 15 days) and POD 365 (± 90 days). The investigators will furthermore track postoperative complications and adverse events, as measured by the Comprehensive Complications Index in addition to instances where additional bariatric surgical interventions are pursued."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Morbid Obesity"],"keywords":["Bariatric surgery","Roux-n-Y gastric bypass","gastric bypass"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 recruitment allocation ratio coordinated at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":262,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"aRYGB","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"BP and roux limb lengths measuring 30% and 15% respectively of patient's total small bowel length.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Surgery"]},{"label":"sRYGB","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard fixed-length RYGB","interventionNames":["Procedure: Surgery"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Surgery","description":"Biliopancreatic limb and roux limb lengths measuring 30 and 15% respectively of patient's total small bowel length in RYGB","armGroupLabels":["aRYGB","sRYGB"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To determine change in TWL after aRYGB compared to sRYGB in morbidly obese patients","description":"Measured in kilograms","timeFrame":"6,12,24 and 60 months from surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To compare rates of DM resolution between aRYGB Vs sRYGB by DM subgroup analysis","description":"Measured by subjects achieving HbA1c less than or equal to 6.5% and subjects able to wean and/or discontinue glycemic control medications","timeFrame":"6,12,24 and 60 months from surgery"},{"measure":"To investigate postoperative efficacy rates of aRYGB compared to sRYGB on alleviating metabolic syndrome in morbid obesity","description":"Measured by a change in serum lipid levels and subjects requiring less antihypertensives","timeFrame":"6,12,24 and 60 months from surgery"},{"measure":"To investigate the presence of postoperative vitamin and nutritional deficiencies between the groups.","timeFrame":"6,12,24 and 60 months from surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* morbidly obese patients (defined by BMI between 40 and 60).\n* Patient who understands and accepts the need for a long-term follow-up.\n* Patient who agrees to be included in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* individuals unable to understand and sign a written consent form\n* patients with history of previous bariatric surgery procedures\n* presence of a severe and evolutive life threatening pathology unrelated to obesity\n* previous gastric or small bowel resection\n* active cancer\n* pregnancy or desired to be pregnant during the study\n* mentally unbalanced patients under supervision or guardianship, patient unable to give consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Salvador Navarrete, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"2162199211","email":"navarrs@ccf.org"},{"name":"Andrew Strong, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"2162183869","email":"stronga3@ccf.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Salvador Navarrete, MD","affiliation":"The Cleveland Clinic","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Cleveland clinic","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Cleveland","state":"Ohio","zip":"44195","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Salvador Navarrete, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"216-219-9211","email":"navarrs@ccf.org"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.4995,"lon":-81.6954}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2026-02-02"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D009767","term":"Obesity, Morbid"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D009765","term":"Obesity"},{"id":"D050177","term":"Overweight"},{"id":"D044343","term":"Overnutrition"},{"id":"D009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"},{"id":"D009750","term":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D001835","term":"Body Weight"},{"id":"D012816","term":"Signs and Symptoms"},{"id":"D013568","term":"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D013514","term":"Surgical Procedures, Operative"}]}},"hasResults":false}

Methods: parallel, randomised, controlled, clinical trial will be carried out, with a total of 90 participants. Exercise modality that showed the best glycaemic control in first phase of GLYCEX study (NCT05612698) will be used. Participantds will be randomised in 3 groups: 1) frequency of 5 days/week, 2) frequency of 3 days/week and 3) frequency of 2 days/week. Data collection will be performed at baseline and after 15-weeks of follow up. Sociodemographic data, medication, comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be collected. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be further determined with an accelerometer, and continuous glycaemia will be determined with a glycaemic monitor, both during seven days, in two time points. The main dependent variable will be the reduction of the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions. The impact of the interventions on health will also be evaluated through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells. Discussion: The results of this study will contribute to better understanding of the response of glucose mechanisms to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes as well as improving physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention. Increasing glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health costs.","detailedDescription":"Principal Aim. The main aim of the preset study is to compare the efficacy of 3 different frequencies of physical exercise on MAGE in adults with prediabetes.\n\nSecondary Aim: The secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of different physical exercise frequencies on the following variables: FPG, glycaemic variability measured continuously (24h), normalization of glycaemic values (reversal), BMI, body composition (percentage and grams of total fat mass and muscle mass; visceral adipose tissue (VAT) waist circumference, lipid profile, inflammation markers, blood pressure and sleep duration and quality; transcriptomic markers of metabolic health assessed in peripheral blood cells (PBC).\n\nParticipants Participants' identification and recruitment will be carried out at different primary care centres from Mallorca, Spain, that formally agree to participate in this phase, and through posters distributed at different points of interest: hospitals, universities, primary care cen-ters, patient associations, etc. Likewise, it will also be disseminated through social net-works, such as Twitter. Interested patients will receive the information sheet, sign the writ-ten informed consent and eligibility criteria will be verified.\n\nSample size and randomization The sample size has been calculated to detect significant differences in MAGE of at least 1.5 mg/dl and considering a standard deviation of 1.4 mg/dl in any of the three modalities and a dropout rate of 20%, so 30 subjects will be needed in each group, with a sample of 90 participants. Randomization will be done by permuted blocks of 8 in a 1:1:1 ratio and stratified by prognostic factors: gender, age and obesity using the open-source Oxford Minimization and Randomization (OxMaR) program.\n\nDescription of intervention\n\nThe intervention will be designed and implemented by a sports science professional. All groups will perform a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise per week or a minimum of 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, always performed under the supervision of a sports science professional. During the intervention participants will progress to 300 minutes of moderate PA or 150 of vigorous PA. Prior to the start of the full intervention, participants will undergo a 3-week pre-intervention physical conditioning. Each intervention will last 12 weeks. Before starting the intervention program, participants will be referred to a physician for medical testing and clearance. During all physical exercise sessions, participants will wear a heart rate (HR) device that will relay their HR to a laptop, from which the sports scientist will be able to control the intensity of the session. The heart rate monitor model to be used is the Polar OH1, which has been validated in previous studies. Polar HR monitors have demonstrated a high level of agreement with the electrocardiogram and can therefore be used as a valid measure of HR in both laboratory and field studies to measure HR during moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Adherence to the intervention will be measured by attendance at the training sessions that make up the intervention. Different exercise frequencies per week will be compared using the modality that best controlled blood glucose in phase 1 (NCT05612698): 1) Five sessions/week; 2) three sessions/week and 3) two sessions/week. As mentioned above, all groups in both phases will perform a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, always performed under the supervision of a sports science professional.\n\n\\- Data collection and procedures: Data collection (visit -1 and 1) will be performed at the Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa). Visit 0 and the intervention sessions will be held at the facilities of the University of the Balearic Islands.\n\n* Visit -1 (V-1): Before inclusion in the study, potential participants will be scheduled for a first visit to verify inclusion and exclusion criteria. During this visit, informed consent and baseline data will be collected including sociodemographic data, medication and concomitant pathologies, tobacco and alcohol consumption, assessment of PA, SB, diet, quality of life, quality of sleep, anthropometric and body composition parameters, blood pressure, biochemical blood analysis and gene expression analysis in blood cells. Participants meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned, stratified by sex, age and obesity, to one of the three intervention groups or control group. The same procedure will be followed for both phases of the study. All participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer, a continuous blood glucose monitor and a daily activities e-diary (intake, sleep, SB and PA) for 14 days to collect accurate baseline PA and blood glucose data.\n* Visit 0 (V0): Participants will be informed of the exercise modality or frequency to which they have been assigned and the days on which the physical exercise sessions will take place will be agreed upon. The accelerometer and the blood glucometer will be taken away in the subsample. During the visit, the participant will wear a heart rate monitor to record their resting heart rate.\n* Visit 1 (V1): Before the follow-up visit (week 15 of intervention), the accelerometer and the continuous glucose monitoring biosensor will be placed for 14 consecutive days, 24h/d, and participants will complete the e-diary during these 14 days. At the end of follow-up (15 weeks), the accelerometer and continuous glucose monitoring biosensor will be re-moved. During this visit medication and concomitant pathologies, assessment of PA, SB, diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption, assessment of the quality of life and quality of sleep, anthropometric and body composition parameters, blood pressure, biochemical blood analysis, gene expression analysis in blood cells and adverse events will be collected for all participants.\n\nData collection\n\n\\- Biological samples and laboratory procedures: At visits V-1, and V1, venous blood samples will be collected, after an overnight fast of ≥8 hours. Blood tests performed will include FPG, HbA1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides (TG), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), platelets, leukocytes, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), advanced glycation end products (AGEs) adiponectin, leptin. Blood samples will be analysed centrally. The TG-glucose index (TG) will also be calculated. Additionally, the expression of relevant genes indicative of metabolic health previously identified \\[59, 60\\], as well as selected genes with a key role in the pathogenesis of T2D will be assessed by real-time qPCR in blood cells.\n\n* Glycaemic variability The continuous blood glucose monitoring system (Dexcom G6, Dexcom Inc., USA) will be used to assess glycaemic variability for 14 consecutive days in the all sample. The sensor will be placed at V-1 and removed at V0. It will be placed again at the beginning of week 15 and removed at V1. The Dexcom G6 sensor will be inserted into the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the lower abdomen (below the umbilicus). To optimise the usefulness of continuous glycaemic monitoring, participants will be asked to keep an electronic diary (e-diary), where they will record the intakes, the timing of intakes and the time they go to sleep and wake up. Mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions and time in range (TIR) will be estimated from the 14-day sensor glucose profiles. Mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions will be calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the increases or decreases in blood glucose (from nadirs to peaks or vice versa) when the rising and falling segments exceed the 1 standard desviation blood glucose value over a 24-hour measurement period.\n* Accelerometer To quantify PA, SB and sleep, participants will wear a wrist accelerometer on the non-dominant arm for 14 days, 24 hours a day (V-1 and V1), and will complete a sleep log. The device (GENEActiv, ActivInsights Ltd., Kimbolton, UK) is a tri-axial accelerometer that allows the following information to be obtained: sedentary time, light PA, moderate PA, vigorous PA and sleep time. The raw data files will be processed with the R package (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) using the open-source R package GGIR, version 1.2-5 (cran.rproject.org/web/packages/ggir/index.html), which has been validated against the self-calibrated functions.\n* Diet At visits V-1 and V1, diet quality will be assessed using the validated 17-item MedDiet adherence questionnaire. Each item is scored 1 (adherence) or 0 (non-adherence), so the total score can range from 0 to 17, with 0 indicating no adherence and 17 indicating maximum adherence. Moreover, to determine the quality of the diet beyond adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a short food frequency questionnaire will be collected. In addition, other questions related to diet will be included in the sleep log, specifically the time of each intake and the food eaten.\n* Physical activity and sedentary behaviour At visits V-1 and V1, the validated REGICOR PA questionnaire for adults, which measures PA levels over the previous 12 months and the validated SB Nurses' Health Study (NHS) questionnaire for the Spanish population, will be administered. The REGICOR PA questionnaire is a sensitive tool to detect moderate and vigorous PA changes in epidemiological studies. It includes a total of 12 questions divided into 3 categories: questions on the type and intensity of leisure-time physical exercise (walking, brisk walking, walking in the countryside, gardening and climbing stairs), occupational PA, and SB, including time spent sleeping. The average daily energy cost of PA is then calculated and expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). The REGICOR PA questionnaire also collects data on the average monthly time spent in light (\\< 4 METs), moderate (4-5.5 METs) and vigorous (≥ 6 METs) PA. Finally, the num-ber of weekly hours of SB is also recorded. The number of hours spent on SB will be recorded using the NHS questionnaire. The types of activities recorded are watching TV, sitting in front of a computer/screen, sitting during transport as a driver or passenger and total sitting time. The frequency of activities is assessed as times in minutes (\\<30 minutes; between 30 and 60 minutes) or hours (between 1 and 9 or more) on an average day, both on weekdays and weekends separately.\n* Anthropometric measurements Height, body weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and body composition (bioelectrical impedance; Tanita BC-418; Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan), will be obtained at visits V-1 and V1 (except for height, which will be measured only at V-1). All anthropometric measurements will be collected according to the recommendations of the International Standards for the Anthropometric assessment (ISAK). Furthermore, all measurements will be performed by well trained technicians or researchers to minimize coefficients of variations. Height will be measured to the mm with a book-foot stadiometer with the participants standing barefoot and with the head placed in the Frankfort plan; body weight will be measured to the nearest 0. 1 kg with a Tanita body fat analyser, which will also measure body composition by bioelectrical impedance; BMI will be calculated using the standard formula (weight (kg)/height (m²)); using a tape measure, WC will be taken at the narrowest point between the lower costal rib and the iliac crest. During height and weight measurements, participants shall adopt a relaxed standing position, with arms crossed over the chest, feet together on the floor and buttock muscles relaxed; both measurements will be taken twice, and the median value will be considered for statistical analyses.\n* Blood pressure At visits V-1 and V1, consecutive blood pressure measurements will be taken in each arm and recorded. The arm with the highest median blood pressure shall be considered for statistical analysis and subsequent measurements during follow-up shall be taken from this same arm (V1). If the median blood pressures of the two arms are identical, subsequent measurements shall be taken from the non-dominant arm. Blood pressure measurements will be taken at the brachial artery after 5 minutes of rest in a seated position with a validated oscillometer (Omron M3). For statistical analyses, the mean of two measurements taken 2 minutes apart will be considered.\n* Quality of life and sleep Quality of life and sleep quality will be assessed at V-1 and V1, using the following validated questionnaires: The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EuroQol-5D) questionnaire is a widely used measure of self-reported health-related quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first comprises five domains: mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. For each domain, participants can indicate the level of problem experienced on a three-point categorical response scale (no problem, some problems or severe problems). From the answers given a single summary score is created, which indicates the self-reported health status. The second part is a Visual Analogue Scale that captures the overall health perceived by the participant in a score ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). The 6-item Medical Outcome Study Son Index (Bo-cado-Sleep) is the shortened version of the 12-item MIS-Sleep scale. It is a validated instrument used to assess the quality and quantity of self-reported sleep during the previous month. It uses a list of six items divided into three different domains: sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, sleep adequacy, and awakening with shortness of breath or headache. The items are scored on a six-point scale ranging from all the time to never. For interpretation, the direct scores are transformed into a scale from 0 to 100, with no cut-off points; the higher the score, the greater the intensity of the item assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["PreDiabetes"],"keywords":["prediabetes","aerobic training resistance","training High intensive interval training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Five sessions/week","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Perform five exercise sessions per week.

Specifically in lung cancer, patients are seven times more prone to developing venous thrombosis, when compared to general population. Platelets influence cancer progression and Tumor microenvironment facilitates platelet activation. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to evaluate platelet aggregation analyzed by aggregometry optics with the use of AggRAM® equipment in patients diagnosed recent non-small cell lung carcinomas, prior to any oncological treatment. Among the secondary objectives, it stands out analyze the primary objective using the PPAnalysis® method (method in developed by our group in partnership with the University of Readings (UK), Plateletworks® and Chrono-log. This is a case-control study, with groups differentiated by the presence or absence of malignant lung neoplasia and matched by age, sex and presence or absence of smoking in the previous 6 months to inclusion. Patients diagnosed with non-cell lung carcinoma Small children without prior treatment will be candidates for participation in the study.\n\nIt is expected that at the end important aspects related to aggregation platelet disease are better characterized in this neoplasm, the most important cause of death from cancer in the world, and therapeutic strategies to improvement in morbidity and mortality in the disease can be developed.","detailedDescription":"Cancer patients are at increased risk of thrombotic complications, especially venous thromboembolism (VTE). The oncology population is seven times more likely to develop thrombosis when compared to the general population, with an incidence of up to 20% of patients during follow-up. It is suggested that the reasons for this greater thrombotic risk are immobility, invasive procedures and changes in coagulation, in addition to possible disorders of platelet aggregation and endothelial function.\n\nThe literature suggests that the basic thromboembolic mechanism would be related to the production, by tumor cells, of pro-coagulant factors such as tissue factor and neoplastic pro-coagulant. PAI-1, the main inhibitor of the plasminogen activator pathway, is also produced by tumor cells. Still, tumor production of factors inhibiting the fibrinolytic system plays a role in hypercoagulability and may contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Regarding arterial thrombotic events, although there is no unanimity regarding the causal relationship between the pathologies, epidemiological data strongly suggest that this complication is more common in patients with cancer, compared to the population without the disease.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths in the world. It is possible that the high mortality from lung cancer is related, at least partially, to the higher incidence of thrombotic complications presented by these patients, compared to those with other types of cancer. Although VTE is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, the use of anticoagulants as primary prophylaxis is not routinely recommended.\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the increased risk of thromboembolic events in cancer patients, especially with lung cancer, which, as mentioned, present, in addition to the aggressiveness of the disease itself, a higher incidence of thrombotic events, are still little known. The main objective of this project is to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in thrombotic events in the population with lung cancer, with clear therapeutic impacts.\n\nThis is a case-control study with groups differentiated by the presence or absence of NSCLC and matched by age, sex and presence or absence of smoking in the 6 months prior to inclusion. Patients diagnosed with NSCLC without prior treatment for the disease will be candidates for participation in the study.\n\nThe primary objective is to compare platelet aggregability by optical aggregometry assessed by the AggRAM® method in patients diagnosed with NSCLC, prior to any oncological treatment, in relation to a control group matched by sex, age and presence or absence of smoking in the previous 6 months. to inclusion Secondary objetives includes laboratorial test of inflammation, coagulation and subgroup analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Assessment of Platelet

Inadequate maternal one-carbon nutrient intake combined with genetic polymorphisms of one-carbon enzymatic mutation, causing one-carbon malnutrition, change fetal methyl metabolic nutrition environment. It not only leads to fetal growth mutation - such as folate and choline deficiency, increasing the risk of fetal neural tube defect but also induce abnormal modifying of fetuses's post-genomic methylation markers, may alter imprinted genes function of progenitors, recompile threshold sensitivity or domain in regulation of metabolic reactions of offspring, resulting in long-lasting effect, increasing the risk of chronic diseases of offspring such as cancer. According to the National Nutrition Survey results show that a considerable proportion of the Taiwanese people had poor one-carbon nutritional status. 48% of women intake 66% below the recommended intake reference value of folate. Whether inadequate parental one-carbon nutrients intake combined with genetic polymorphisms of one-carbon enzymatic mutation will cause one-carbon malnutrition of fetus, affecting fetal growth and modifying the risk of cancer development relationship of offspring. It is due to the lack of local ethnic data and empirical scientific reference at home and abroad, so it can not plan an effective maternal and children nutrient education and prevention strategies about methyl nutrition for early cancer prevention for Taiwanese. Therefore, indigenous people is the intended population of study in this project, screening of healthy pregnant women with high risk factor for cancer and obese pregnant women, and detection of one-carbon nutrient intake and biochemical assessment of the nutritional status of the study group.

It is rare in children as compared to adults. The severity may be related to greater involvement of genetic factors in children. The impact of genetics in the development of SLE is important, and the risk of recurrence in siblings evaluated by lambda S ratio is 30 in SLE, while it is 15 for type-1 diabetes and 8 rheumatoid arthritis, thereby indicating high impact of genetics in SLE.\n\nRecently, the group of Professor Yanick Crow in Manchester and other teams has identified new forms of lupus Mendelian genetics. The TREX1 and genes involved in the SAMHD1 frostbite lupus.\n\nNearly 2 % of all adult subjects with SLE have a heterozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene, which therefore represents the first genetic cause of SLE. The team of Professor Crow also identified the ACP5 gene that is responsible for SLE associated with Spondylo-epiphyseal enchondro-epiphyseal dysplasia (syndromic lupus). Other groups have identified mutations in two genes encoding a DNAse (DNAse1 and DNAse1L3) responsible for familial monogenic forms of SLE. These new genes SLE were identified through research of germ-line mutations in cases of lupus syndromic or family. In collaboration with Professor Crow, we are currently undergoing characterization of a novel gene of SLE in a family and we have identified a second locus identified in another family. The identification of these genes provides a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance in humans. The frequency of these genetic forms is not known. There is very little data on the immunological phenotype of these patients.\n\nThis is a clinical study to investigate the genetic and immunological abnormalities associated with pediatric SLE. The aim are to:\n\n* study the genetics of pediatric SLE (or syndromic or family) and to search for mutations in the known genetic lupus or new genes in collaboration with Professor Yanick Crow.\n* study the lymphocyte subpopulations and serum cytokines in pediatric patients with SLE (or syndromic or family) in the large Rhône- Alpes- Auvergne area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)"],"keywords":["Systemic lupus erythematosus","genetic","immunological","pediatric","mutation","lupus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":271,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Blood sampling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Genetic: Blood sampling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Blood sampling","description":"Immunologic and genetic analysis from a single blood sample.","armGroupLabels":["Blood sampling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"New genes identification","description":"Description: Identification of genetic mutations in the following genes: TREX1, SAMHD1, ACP5, DNAse1, DNAse1L3, or in new lupus genes.","timeFrame":"Once.

Recent studies show severe outcomes of COVID-19 patients specially in males who suffer from androgenetic alopecia, would be significant and is of particular interest of this study and could help further support the hypothesis that anti-androgen therapy might represents an additional potential intervention against severe COVID-19.","detailedDescription":"INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2) occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China in December 2019. Belonging to the family Beta-coronavirus, this virus can cause variable symptoms ranging from mild common cold-like symptoms to severe life threatening pneumonia. Numerous cases of new onset of skin lesions in COVID-19 patients are spreading across the globe. There are also some reports of aggravation of prior skin disorders. While severe COVID-19 symptoms and high mortality primarily manifested in older adults specially adult males, this sexual dimorphism in the severity of COVID-19 patients predisposed possibly due to increased androgen levels particularly in males suffering from androgenetic alopecia (AGA) would be significant and is of particular interest of this study and could help further support the hypothesis that anti-androgen therapy might represents an additional potential intervention against severe COVID-19.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Association of Androgenetic alopecia and severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nPLACE OF STUDY: COVID-19 isolation unit of Jinnah postgraduate medical center (JPMC) Karachi, Sindh province, Pakistan.\n\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY: This study will be conducted on patients admitted in COVID-19 isolation unit of JPMC Karachi. Permission from the institutional ethical review committee will be taken prior to conduction of study, demographic data and written informed consent will be taken from every patient. Sample size of study would be 300 hospitalized patients of COVID-19. Detailed history and examination of patients including be conducted in COVID-19 patients. Scoring of AGA be evaluated using Hamilton-Norwood scale (HNS) in men and Ludwig scale in female. Severity of the COVID-19 be measured by COVID severity score (A-DROP). Study is aimed to evaluate association of AGA and severity of COVID-19, frequency of AGA in covid 19 and whether the lung involvement correlates with the severity of AGA or whether the proportion of AGA is higher in intensive care/fatal COVID-19.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS: Data will be analysed using SPSS version 23 registered for Microsoft windows. Mean and standard deviation will be calculated for expression of quantitative variables like age, weight, duration of disease symptoms. Frequencies and percentages will be calculated for the qualitative variables like gender, co-morbidities, frequency and severity of AGA, disease outcome and AGA associated with severity of COVID-19. Effect modifiers like age, gender, weight, co-morbidities, duration of symptoms will be controlled through stratification. Post-stratification will be recalculated and chi-square test will be applied. P-value of \\<0.05% will be considered as significant."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Androgenetic Alopecia","Coronavirus Disease 2019","Covid19","Male Pattern Baldness","Female Pattern Baldness","COVID-19 Pneumonia"],"keywords":["Covid19","Androgenetic alopecia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"4 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Androgenetic Alopecia Frequency in Participants.","description":"Frequency of Androgenetic alopecia in patients be noted.","timeFrame":"Day 1 of admission"},{"measure":"Severity of Androgenetic Alopecia in Patients","description":"Severity of androgenetic alopecia be measured using Hamilton and norwood scale (HNS) less than 3 or 3-7.\n\nIn females using ludwig scale: less than 2 or 2-3.

Women with PCOS undergoing IVF are at an increased risk for developing both multiple gestation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Since insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder, the administration of metformin before or during an IVF cycle has been practiced for years in an attempt to improve follicular parameters necessary for reproductive success. Recently, a growing body of evidence has implicated alternative insulin sensitizing drugs, namely Myo-Inositol, in improving various manifestations of the disorder in this women population. Little has been done to evaluate the effect of Myo-Inositol co-treatment on the reproductive performance of PCOS women undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). In this prospective comparative randomized controlled study, women will be randomized into two groups: Women in the control group will receive folic acid daily. Women in the study group will receive Myo-Inositol, in combination with alpha- lipoic acid and cysteine, per day plus folic acid supplemented daily along with ovarian stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sterility","Infertility"],"keywords":["Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","Myo-Inositol","Assisted Reproductive Technology","oocyte performance","pregnancy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Myo-Inositol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1g Myo-inositol per day, in combination with alpha- lipoic acid and cysteine, (Celine Tablets; Surveal Pharmaceuticals; Belgium) + 400 ug of Folic acid","interventionNames":["Drug: Myo-inositol"]},{"label":"No intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard care: 400 ug of Folic acid"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Myo-inositol","description":"Patients belonging to this group will receive 1 gram of Myo-Inositol, in combination with alpha- lipoic acid and cysteine, (Celine Tablets; Surveal Pharmaceuticals; Belgium) starting 6 weeks prior to stimulation and extending until final oocyte maturation, combined with 400 µg of folic acid supplemented daily.","armGroupLabels":["Myo-Inositol"],"otherNames":["Celine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oocyte yield","timeFrame":"1 day from ovum pick up"},{"measure":"Maturation rate","timeFrame":"1 day from ovum pick up"},{"measure":"Fertilization rate","timeFrame":"16-18 hours post insemination"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood profile (fasting sugar and insulin levels, Testosterone, Sex Hormone-Binding protein, DHEAs, and Androstenedione)","timeFrame":"Prior to and 6 weeks post enrollment"},{"measure":"Number of gonadotropin ampules","timeFrame":"1 day from oocyte maturation trigger"},{"measure":"Obstetrical outcome (preterm birth)","timeFrame":"From 24 to 36 weeks gestation"},{"measure":"Obstetrical outcome (low birth weight)","timeFrame":"From 24 to 36 weeks gestation"},{"measure":"Obstetrical outcome (gestational diabetes)","timeFrame":"From 24 to 36 weeks gestation"},{"measure":"Obstetrical outcome (preeclampsia)","timeFrame":"From 24 to 36 weeks gestation"},{"measure":"Obstetrical outcome (admission to neonatal intensive care)","timeFrame":"From 24 to 36 weeks gestation"},{"measure":"Number of stimulation days","timeFrame":"1 day from oocyte maturation trigger"},{"measure":"Embryo quality","timeFrame":"3 to 5 days from ovum pick up"},{"measure":"Miscarriage rate","timeFrame":"7 weeks post LMP"},{"measure":"Ongoing pregnancy","timeFrame":"20 weeks post LMP"},{"measure":"Live birth rate","timeFrame":"24 to 42 weeks gestation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-40 years at the time of enrollment.\n* Women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria indicated by oligoamenorrhea (six or fewer menstrual cycles during a period of 1 year), hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, or alopecia) or hyperandrogenemia (elevated levels of total or free T) and typical features of ovaries on ultrasound scan.\n* Planned IVF/ICSI treatment.\n* Normal uterine cavity (as assessed by hysteroscopy or HSG).\n* Normal hormonal investigation: TSH and PRL.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Azoospermia.\n* Other medical conditions causing ovulatory disorders, such as hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, or adrenal hyperplasia.\n* Hypersensitivity to Myo-Inositol or its derivatives.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Johnny Awwad, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"009611350000","phoneExt":"5606","email":"jawwad@aub.edu.lb"},{"name":"Layal Hamdar, MS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"009611350000","phoneExt":"5606","email":"lh72@aub.edu.lb"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Johnny Awwad, MD","affiliation":"American University of Beirut Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"American University of Beirut Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beirut","country":"Lebanon","contacts":[{"name":"Johnny Awwad, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00961 1 350000","phoneExt":"5606","email":"jawwad@aub.edu.lb"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.8933,"lon":35.5016}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"39421989","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Shukla R, Chadha M, Adya A, Yadav A, Singh N, Chauhan RS, Ahmad A, Tiwari RK.

Using motivational print materials is one way to encourage individuals to increase their physical activity. This study will evaluate the effect that an enhanced version of an individualized, print-based motivational program has on increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals.","detailedDescription":"Currently, only 32% of adults in the United States participate in regular physical activity. Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association recommend that adults engage in a minimum of 2 ½ hours of physical activity each week. In a previous study, individuals who received motivational print materials in the mail increased their weekly physical activity more than individuals who received no motivational materials or who received motivational support over the telephone. However, about half of those who were mailed the print materials still did not reach the recommended goal of 2 ½ hours of physical activity per week. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an enhanced version of an individualized, print-based motivational program versus a previously tested print-based motivational program at increasing physical activity levels in sedentary individuals.\n\nThis study will enroll healthy, sedentary individuals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a print-based, individually tailored motivational program or an enhanced version of the same program. All participants will attend a baseline study visit, which will include body measurements, physical activity assessments, and health and psychological questionnaires. A select group of participants will also take part in an exercise test. Participants will then document their monthly physical activity. Study researchers will use this information, as well as the completed questionnaires, to develop individualized reports, manuals, and tip sheets that include feedback and strategies for increasing physical activity for each participant. Materials will be mailed to participants 14 times throughout the year. Participants in the enhanced intervention will receive additional materials that focus on increasing social support, self regulation, and outcome expectations, as well as materials on how to effectively monitor physical activity levels. They will also attend one study visit to assess their goals with the research staff. At Months 6 and 12, baseline evaluations will be repeated and all participants will be interviewed to assess physical activity levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy"],"keywords":["Physical Activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":256,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Print-based, individually tailored motivational program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Individualized Print-Based Motivational Program"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Enhanced version of the print-based, individually tailored motivational program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Individualized Print-Based Motivational Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Individualized Print-Based Motivational Program","description":"Study researchers will develop individualized reports, manuals, and tip sheets that include feedback and strategies for increasing physical activity for each participant.

Exercise induced autonomic failure contributes to the development of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. Treatments that blunt the consequences of exercise induced autonomic failure, such as preserving the post-exercise counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, may improve awareness of hypoglycemia. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is an extremely promising agent. In healthy volunteers, intravenous administration of naloxone during exercise preserved the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the following day (1). In this study, investigators will extend the clinical applicability by administering intranasal naloxone to individuals with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, the investigators will use a randomized, placebo controlled, crossover design to administer drug or placebo to patients with type 1 diabetes during acute exercise and assess the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the following day. The use of intranasal naloxone is a highly innovative aspect of this proposal. Intranasal naloxone translates readily to clinical use and, as demonstrated by the investigators preliminary data, achieves similar plasma drug concentrations as after IV administration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Naloxone, then placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Naloxone then placebo"]},{"label":"2","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo, then Naloxone","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo then Naloxone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Naloxone then placebo","description":"naloxone intranasal 4mg, then placebo","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo then Naloxone","description":"placebo then naloxone intranasal 4mg","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Symptom Score","description":"The primary outcome variable for Aim 1 will be the difference, naloxone vs. saline, in symptom scores collected using a standard questionnaire during the hypoglycemic clamp on Day 2, after administration of intranasal treatment during exercise on Day 1.\n\nthe scale for symptoms score is 0-72.

Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures and diagnostic methods followed physicians' routine clinical practice using a 12-week treatment regimen (four visits plus two interim data collection windows) or a 24-week treatment regimen (four visits plus three interim data collection windows) and is based on the anticipated regular follow-up for patients undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Participants are observed for the duration of the ABBVIE REGIMEN therapy and for up to 24 weeks after treatment completion.","detailedDescription":"This prospective, multi-center observational study in adult participants chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), receiving the interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN with or without RBV are offered the opportunity to participate in this study during a routine clinical visit at the participating sites at the discretion of the physician and is made independently from this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the participant the opportunity to participate in this study.\n\nAfter written informed consent is obtained, demographics, HCV disease characteristics, co-morbidities, co-medication, treatment details, and laboratory assessments as recorded in the participant's medical records (source documentation) are documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Participants are observed for the duration of the ABBVIE REGIMEN therapy and for up to 24 weeks after treatment completion. No patient identifiable information was captured; a unique participant number was automatically allocated by the web based system once the investigator or designee created a new participant file.\n\nThis study focuses on collecting real world data. Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures and diagnostic methods follow physicians' routine clinical practice. The observational study period entailed the following data collection schemes:\n\n* 12-week treatment regimen: four visits plus two interim data collection windows\n* 24-week treatment regimen: four visits plus three interim data collection windows This schedule was based on the anticipated regular follow-up for patients undergoing treatment for CHC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Hepatitis C"],"keywords":["Chronic Hepatitis C","Paritaprevir/r - Ombitasvir, ± Dasabuvir","Sustained Virological Response","Observational Study","Chronic Hepatitis C genotype 1"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participants with Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 (HCV + GT1)","description":"ABBVIE REGIMEN (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \\[25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily\\] with or without dasabuvir \\[250 mg twice daily\\]), and with or without weight-based ribavirin (± RBV;
